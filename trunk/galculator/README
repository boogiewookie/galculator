galculator
==========

a GTK 2 based scientific calculator 

For installation information see the INSTALL file.
For a list of shortcuts, see doc/shortcuts
There is a short man page (man galculator)
Information on Formula Entry mode can be found below.
In general, galculator's homepage galculator.sf.net is the most reliable
and up2date source of information.

RPMs: a spec file is included (galculator.spec). Thanks to Victor. Or
download at http://dag.wieers.com/packages/galculator/ (thanks to Dag Wieers) 
DEBs: galculator is in DEBIAN/unstable. Thanks to seb128.

Formula Entry Mode
==================

Since version 1.2.0 galculator features a formula entry mode. This mode is one 
more step towards a calculator accepting input as written on the paper. 
galculator's formula entry mode aims to provide all the features of the 
algebraic mode.

This part of galculator is developed actively. This section gives an overview 
of the functions currently implemented and points out some restrictions.

So far formula entry mode accepts only decimal numbers as input. All algebraic 
operations and functions of the algebraic mode are supported. Operations can 
only be specified by their one char long identifier, which is for example 
displayed by the Arithmetic Operation display module. String operation 
identifiers (e.g. AND, OR, XOR, MOD, LSH - use &, |, x, m, < instead) are not 
yet supported.

Operation			Single char identifier	
+, -, *, /			+, -, *, /
percent x%y (x percent of y)	%
power x^y			^
module (MOD)			m
left shift (LSH)		<
right shift (INV + LSH)		>
AND				&
OR				|
XOR				x

Factorial and complement are regarded as functions. All functions' argument 
have to be enclosed by brackets. Therefore sin 3 is not possible yet and has to 
be written as sin(3).

Function			Function identifier	Example
Trigonometric functions: 
Sine, Cosine, Tangent		sin, cos, tan		sin(0.5)
their inverse 			asin, acos, atan	asin(0.5)
their hyperbolic variants	sinh, cosh, tanh	sinh(0.5)
and the inverse of those	asinh, acosh, atanh	asinh(0.5)
natural logarithm (base e)	ln			ln(3)
logarithm (base 10)		log			log(3)
square root			sqrt			sqrt(3)
factorial			!			(3)! brackets mandatory
complement			~			~(3) brackets mandatory

If formula entry mode's parser encounters an (syntax) error, the formula entry 
text is turned red.
