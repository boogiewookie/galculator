galculator 1.1.1 - two releases within two days. uuuh! Never mind. Two quite 
important bug fixes
	* preferences dialog's font and color dialog work again
	* again, GTK 2.0 is enough to build
and a cool new feature
	* configurable variable type (number of bits and [un]signed) in HEX/OCT/BIN 
	mode. Enjoy converting your unsigned 7-bit binary to a 13-bit signed 
	hexadecimal.
are reason enough for an update.

        * constants popup, user defined constants
	* save to/read from and add to memory as much as you want

        * libglade
        * X middle mouse button pasting
        * and the bug fixes
        * instant apply preferences dialog
