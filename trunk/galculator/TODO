1.1.5/1.2.0(?)
~~~~~

[DONE] tooltips in RPN mode

[ ] formula mode - entry is no own mode but an addon for both modes? YES

	text entry: if text entry active, input only occurs here
		if not active, usual procedure but with recording in text entry
		
	UPDATE: entry has to be a new mode as it is impossible to integrate the
		entry with the existing modes: e.g. entry is active. we click
		the 5 and then the sin button: entry is "5sin" while it should
		be "sin5". problem is that functions operate on current display.
	
	UPDATE: own mode but as now. every button click is only routed to the
		text entry.

[ ] right button mouse click gives popup for bringing back menu

parser:
[ ]	!
[ ]	sign
[ ]	better exit in error case
